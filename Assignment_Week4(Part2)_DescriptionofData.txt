*********************A description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem***********************

For any "Data Science Project" data is of paramount importance.For our study we need data about neighborhoods in each of the cities.The link to explore the neighborhoods of New york exists free on the web which can be downloaded. The link to this dataset https://geo.nyu.edu/catalog/nyu_2451_34572. The data is in JSON format so we can load the data and can transform it into a Pandas Dataframe. We can then use the geopy library to get the latitude and longitude values of New York City. We can then create a map of NewYork with neighborhoods superimposed on top by using the Visualization library Folium. Now we can finally focus our attention to the borough Manhattan and can explore further the neighborhood that the city has to offer. We can use Foursquare API's by using our credentials to get the categories or venues of each neighborhood within a particular radius of say 5oomts and can find the top 10 most common venues from these neighborhoods which will help us to know the most common venues from these neighborhoods.

The same can be done for the city of Toronto to explore the venues of the borough Downtown Toronto. However, unlike NewYork, the neighborhood data of the city of Toronto is not readily available on the internet. But, a Wikipedia page exists that has all the information we need to explore and cluster the neighborhoods. so we have to scrape the Wikipedia page and wrangle the data, clean it, and then read it into a pandas dataframe so that it is in a structured format like the New York dataset. Now we can replicate the analysis that we did to the NewYork city datset to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto.The link of the wikipedia page is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M.

Now after finding the most common venue from Manhattan,NewYork and DowntownToronto, Toronto we can compare the neighborhoods and based on the preferences of an individual, one can decide which city to move in.
