****************A description of the problem and a discussion of the background****************************

Newyork city and the city of Toronto are very diverse and the financial capitals of USA and Canada respectively.
A person has two Job offers nearly of the same pay and same role, one from the Borough Manhattan,Newyork and the other from the Borough Downtown Toronto, Toronto but he is neither from these cities. As the job offer is very lucrative, so he doesn't want to loose this opportunity and therefore he has to make a decision to shift to either of these cities and to settle down in future. But before taking any decision he wants to explore the neighborhoods of these cities so that he can make a informed decision and what these cities have to offer to him who is contemplating to make a choice on seeking a life in either of these cities.
The deciding factor for most would be on how lively,diverse, supportive, vibrant and unique each of the cities can be when compared to each other. The business problem in this study assumes that people who would be interested in this study are those who would like to create a projection of potential life and activities in these neighborhoods if the subject moves to live in one of them. The decision to choose one over the other would depend on the diverse and the uniqueness in the neighborhoods in each of these cities.
